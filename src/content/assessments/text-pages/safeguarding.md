## **Adult Safeguarding Policy**

**Together Assessments**
Version 1.0 – August 2025
Review date: August 2026 (or sooner if guidance changes)

### **1. Policy Statement**

Together Assessments is committed to safeguarding adults at risk of abuse or neglect and to promoting their wellbeing, in line with the Care Act 2014, CQC Regulation 13, and all relevant UK safeguarding legislation.

We recognise that safeguarding is everyone’s responsibility and that adults have the right to live free from abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Our service is currently for adults (18+) and operates within a ~30-mile radius of DN39 in North Lincolnshire.

### **2. Scope**

This policy applies to:

* The Sole Trader (Adriana Ferrari)
* External HCPC-registered Clinical Supervisor(s) contracted by Together Assessments
* Any other contractors or associates engaged in delivering the service

### **3. Legal & Regulatory Framework**

* **Care Act 2014** – Statutory duties for safeguarding adults
* **Working Together to Safeguard Adults** – Multi-agency approach
* **Mental Capacity Act 2005** – Supporting decision-making and protecting those lacking capacity
* **CQC Fundamental Standards** – Regulation 13: Safeguarding service users from abuse and improper treatment
* **Human Rights Act 1998** – Protecting the right to life, freedom from degrading treatment, and privacy

### **4. Definitions**

* **Adult at Risk:** A person aged 18+ who has care and support needs, is experiencing or at risk of abuse/neglect, and cannot protect themselves.
* **Abuse:** Can be physical, emotional, sexual, financial, discriminatory, organisational, neglect or acts of omission, or self-neglect.
* **DSL (Designated Safeguarding Lead):** Named person responsible for managing safeguarding concerns.
* **Clinical Supervisor:** HCPC-registered psychologist providing professional oversight and case review.

### **5. Roles & Responsibilities**

DSL: Adriana

* Receives and logs safeguarding concerns.
* Decides on action required in consultation with the Clinical Supervisor if action is not more readily apparent.
* Makes referrals to the North Lincolnshire Safeguarding Adults Team.
* Notifies the CQC if required.

**Deputy DSL:** HCPC-registered Clinical Supervisor.

* Acts as DSL if Adriana is unavailable.

**All Staff/Associates:**

* Recognise and report concerns immediately to the DSL.

### **7. Population & Context**

North Lincolnshire population ~167,000 (ONS 2021).

* **Urban (e.g. Scunthorpe):** Younger, more diverse, higher service demand.
* **Rural:** Older, higher rates of isolation, fewer local services, transport barriers.
   Local safeguarding challenges differ between these settings and our procedures must take account of accessibility and vulnerability factors in both.

### **8. Partner Agencies**

Potential collaboration partners:

* Age UK North Lincolnshire
* Citizens Advice North Lincolnshire
* Mind Lincolnshire
* Lincs Inspire Autism/ADHD Support Groups
* NHS Community Mental Health Teams
* Carers’ Support Centre

3. **Record** – Write factual notes (date, time, what happened, who was present).
4. **Report** – Notify the DSL immediately.
5. **Review** – DSL decides next steps in consultation with Clinical Supervisor.
6. **Refer** – DSL contacts NLSAB using the details above if the threshold is met.
7. **Report to CQC** – If the concern relates to a regulated activity or registered service.

### **10. Information Sharing**

We will share information lawfully and proportionately under the Care Act 2014, Data Protection Act 2018, and GDPR, prioritising the prevention of harm. Consent will be sought unless doing so increases the risk to the person.
