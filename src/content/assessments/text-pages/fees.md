**Financial Health Inequality**
I am personally and professionally motivated by equity, and I understand costs can be a larger barrier to some, so I am actively seeking ways to subsidise my offerings for anyone who otherwise couldn't access my services. If this applies to you, please do let me know, and I might be able to support you in reducing or eliminating costs prior to my registration on the right-to-choose register which can be a lengthy process.

If you are able and interested in contributing towards a fund for people for whom cost is a barrier, please [get in touch](peersupport@togetherassessments.co.uk).
