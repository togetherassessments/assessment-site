## What are cookies and similar technologies?

Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a website. Similar technologies include browser storage (like localStorage) which works in a similar way. These help websites remember your preferences and provide a better experience.

## What we use on this website

We use two types of storage on Together Assessments:

### Strictly necessary browser storage

These are essential for the website to work properly. We don't need your consent to use these because they're required to provide services you've requested.

| Name | Type | Purpose | Duration |
|------|------|---------|----------|
| `accessibility-preferences` | Browser storage (localStorage) | Stores your accessibility preferences including font choice, theme, text size, line height, and reading ruler settings. This is essential for displaying the site according to your accessibility needs. | Permanent (until you clear your browser data or reset settings) |
| `cookie-consent` | Browser storage (localStorage) | Stores your cookie consent choice and when you made it. Essential for remembering your decision about analytics cookies. | 6 months (we'll ask again after this time) |

**Important:** None of this stored data is sent to third parties or used for tracking. It stays in your browser and is only used to display the site according to your preferences.

### Analytics cookies (optional)

These help us understand how visitors use our site so we can improve it. We only use these if you click "Accept" on our cookie banner.

| Name | Type | Purpose | Duration |
|------|------|---------|----------|
| `_ga` | Cookie | Google Analytics - identifies unique visitors to help us understand site usage. | 2 years |
| `_ga_[ID]` | Cookie | Google Analytics - property-specific identifier for tracking across our site. | 2 years |

**Provider:** Google Analytics is provided by Google LLC. You can learn more about how Google uses data at [google.com/policies/privacy/partners](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

## Managing your preferences

You can change your cookie preferences at any time:

1. **Cookie banner:** When you first visit our site, you'll see a banner asking you to accept or reject analytics cookies.

2. **Cookie Preferences link:** Click the "Cookie Preferences" link in the website footer at any time to change your choice.

3. **Browser settings:** You can also clear cookies and browser storage through your browser settings. However, this will remove your accessibility preferences and you'll need to set them up again.

## Your rights

Under UK data protection law, you have the right to:

- Withdraw your consent for analytics cookies at any time using the Cookie Preferences link
- Clear all cookies and browser storage through your browser settings
- Object to processing of your data for analytics purposes

## Changes to this policy

We may update this cookie policy from time to time. When we make changes, we'll update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.

If we make significant changes that affect how we use cookies, we'll notify you by displaying a prominent notice on our website or by clearing your existing consent so you can make a fresh choice.
