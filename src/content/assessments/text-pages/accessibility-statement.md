  metaDescription: "Our commitment to accessible services. Reasonable adjustments, alternative formats, and inclusive communication for all clients. Equality Act 2010 compliant."
---
We commit to:

1. Providing a service that is accessible to all adults who meet the service’s eligibility criteria, regardless of protected characteristics.
2. Make reasonable adjustments in line with the Equality Act 2010 to remove or reduce barriers to access.
3. Ensure compliance with the Accessible Information Standard by asking all clients about their communication and information needs, recording them, and acting to meet them.
4. Provide information in alternative formats (e.g. large print, easy read, digital, or via a third-party interpreter) wherever reasonably practicable.
5. Use respectful, inclusive, gender-, and neuro-affirming language in all communication.
6. Monitor service provision to ensure fairness and identify any patterns of exclusion.
7. Never tolerate harassment, bullying, or discriminatory behaviour in any form.

Uphold confidentiality and respect for individual identity, culture, and life choices, within the limits of safeguarding and legal obligations.


We will:

* Ask all service users at the point of intake whether they have communication or information needs, in line with the Accessible Information Standard.
* Record and flag these needs in the client record so they are always considered in communication and service delivery.
* Provide documents in accessible formats (e.g. large print, plain English, easy read, or digital versions) where reasonably practicable.
* Offer remote or home-based assessments where travel or mobility is a barrier, within the service’s operational area.
* Consider sensory needs and adapt the assessment environment as far as possible, accordingly.
* Permit Staff to use accessibility software (e.g., Dragon Professional, Speechify, Grammarly) as reasonable adjustments under the Equality Act 2010 to ensure high-quality, accessible communication and a neurodivergent-friendly workforce.
