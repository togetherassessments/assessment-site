# **Together Assessments – Terms of Service**

Engaging with Together Assessments (“Together Assessments”, “we”, “us”, or “our” in these Terms and Conditions) as a client, potential client, website user, or interested party includes accessing our website (www.togetherassessments.co.uk), online booking systems, digital forms, video consultations, and any electronic communications. By doing so, you accept these Terms and Conditions in full, together with any other policies, service documents, or procedures we provide to you or publish on our website.

Together Assessments provides structured neurodevelopmental assessments for adults aged 18 and over. Our assessments use recognised gold-standard tools and follow evidence-based practice to develop a formulation, outlining your neurodevelopmental profile, strengths, challenges, and recommendations for support. Formal diagnostic outcomes are waitlisted at this time while we prepare for CQC registration.

Our service is not a crisis, emergency, or medical treatment provider. If your needs indicate high risk, a mental health emergency, or requirements beyond our scope, we will signpost you to more appropriate services.

To deliver our services, we may need to collect personal information from you. We store this information securely and will not share it unless you authorise us to do so or where we are legally required (e.g., safeguarding concerns or serious risk of harm). All information is processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 and UK GDPR.

## **Governing Law**

These Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Any disputes will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.

## **Clients Accessing the Service**

Whether you access our service as an enquiry, as part of a pre-screening, or as a booked assessment, you agree that Together Assessments will need to review, use, and store information relevant to your neurodevelopmental history and presentation.

You agree that:

* We may communicate relevant information to your GP or safeguarding services if required to protect your safety or the safety of others.
* You will provide information that is accurate, complete, and in comprehensible English.
* You will inform us if any information you supplied becomes inaccurate or changes.
* You will follow any instructions given by our assessors to support the assessment process.
* You will notify us promptly of any adverse emotional or mental health changes that might affect your participation.


You further agree that:

* You will not amend or interfere with any documents, summaries, or reports issued to you.
* You will provide accurate physical, mental health, and developmental history to the best of your knowledge.
* You will disclose any safeguarding or risk-related concerns relevant to your assessment.
* You will attend pre-booked appointments and understand that missed appointments are subject to the cancellation terms in your Client Contract.


## **Service Scope and Limitations**

You acknowledge that:

* Together Assessments provides formulations and recommendations, not formal diagnostic outcomes at this stage.
* Clinicians may hold differing reasonable views based on the information available.
* We do not provide medication, medical treatment, therapy, or crisis management.
* Our assessments are designed to support understanding, workplace adjustments, or preparation for later diagnostic referrals.

If additional concerns arise during the process, we may halt or postpone the assessment until it is clinically appropriate to continue.



## **Our Service Commitment**

Together Assessments will:

* Conduct a structured, evidence-based assessment using recognised tools (e.g., ADOS-2, ADI-R, developmental history, DIVA-5, QbCheck).
* Provide a clear written formulation outlining relevant traits, strengths, challenges, and recommendations.
* Offer a feedback session to discuss findings and ask questions.

We may request additional information from you or a third party (with consent) to ensure the assessment is robust.

You may choose to stop the assessment at any time; however, you understand that doing so may limit the usefulness of the formulation, and fees may still apply as set out in your Client Contract.



## **Patient Portal and Digital Platforms**

We take reasonable precautions to protect against failures of our digital systems and maintain secure storage of assessment materials.

We cannot guarantee:

* Uninterrupted access
* Complete security
* Absence of transmission errors
* That defects will always be corrected


We are not responsible for data corruption or issues arising from telecommunications providers.



## **Paying for Our Service**

When booking an assessment, you agree that:

* Fees are payable as outlined in your Client Contract and Information Pack.
* Assessment bookings may require upfront payment or instalments where agreed.
* Payment is the responsibility of the person named on the booking, unless otherwise arranged.
* Services may be paused or cancelled if payment is not received.


You may cancel your assessment according to the terms set out in your Client Contract. Missed appointments or late cancellations may result in fees being applied.

Together Assessments reserves the right to update fees or pricing at any time for future services.



## **Use of QbCheck**

Where QbCheck is used:

* It is provided by Qbtech AB and securely hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in Ireland.
* We may share limited required data (e.g., date of birth, sex, medication status) under a unique patient ID.
* No directly identifiable information is shared with Qbtech.
* With your consent, anonymised data may be stored for up to five years for research and development purposes.



## **Zero Tolerance to Unacceptable Behaviour**

We are committed to providing a safe environment for both clients and staff.

We will not tolerate:

* Verbal abuse
* Threats or intimidation
* Discriminatory behaviour
* Sexual or inappropriate comments

Anyone engaging in such behaviour may be discharged from the service and, where appropriate, reported to authorities.

## **Safeguarding**

If we believe that you or someone else may be at risk of harm, we may contact your GP, local safeguarding services, or emergency services.

Our service is not a crisis service. If you are in immediate danger or need urgent help, please contact:

* NHS 111
* Your local NHS Crisis Team
* 999
* Your nearest A&E



## **Recordings**

Some assessment sessions may be recorded to support scoring accuracy and supervision. This will only occur with your explicit consent.

Recordings are:

* Stored securely
* Used only for quality assurance
* Deleted within approximately 4–6 weeks


## **Enduring Conditions**

If any part of these Terms is found unlawful, the remaining clauses continue in full force. If we delay enforcing any clause, we may still enforce it later.

You have the right to request details of the data we hold about you under data protection law.



## **Limitation of Liability**

You accept that Together Assessments is not responsible for:

* Delays caused by events beyond our control
* Business or financial losses
* Any indirect or consequential losses
* Outcomes based on inaccurate or incomplete information you provide


Our assessments offer formulations, not diagnoses or medical treatment, and no guarantee is given regarding how third parties will interpret or use any formulation or report.

Nothing in these Terms limits liability where such limitation would be unlawful.
