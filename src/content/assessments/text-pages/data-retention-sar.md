**Privacy & Consent (Summary)**

* **Why we need your data** – To provide you with an adult autism/ADHD assessment and keep you safe.
* **What we collect** – Contact details, GP details, personal history, assessment notes, reports, and **mandatory video recordings of sessions** (used for supervision).
* **Where it is stored** – Securely in an encrypted Google Workspace account. Only Adriana and their supervisor(s) can access it.
* **How long we keep it** – Reports and notes for 7 years; recordings are deleted once reviewed in supervision (normally within 4–6 weeks).
* **AI/assistive tools** – Tools like Grammarly, Speechify, Dragon, and ChatGPT Business may help Adriana and their supervisor(s) deliver your care. These tools use enterprise safeguards (no training/advertising, no storage). Final reports are always stored securely in Google systems.
* **Sharing** – information about you is shared with supervisor(s) to help with the quality of care you receive. Information about you may be shared with local and emergency services if there is a risk to someone. Otherwise your information will only be shared with others (like your GP) if you agree to this. 
* **Your rights** – You can ask to see, correct, download or delete your data by emailing [data@togetherassessments.co.uk](mailto:data@togetherassessments.co.uk), or complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ico.org.uk / 0303 123 1113).
