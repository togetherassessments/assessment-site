## **Refunds and Cancellations**

**Together Assessments**\
Version 1.1 – November 2025
Review date: November 2026 (or sooner if guidance or law changes)

### **1. Purpose**

This policy explains how payments, cancellations, and refunds are managed at Together Assessments. It aims to be transparent, lawful, and compassionate, recognising that neurodivergent adults may experience difficulties with organisation, communication, or remembering appointments.

### **2. Payment terms**

* Full payment, or an agreed instalment plan, must be received before assessment work or sessions begin.
* Work includes administrative preparation, scoring, and supervision.
* Payment confirms the booking and agreement to this policy.


### **3. Cooling-off period (Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013)**

* If you book and pay online or by bank transfer, you have a 14-day cooling-off period starting the day after payment.

* If you change your mind within that period before any assessment work begins, you will receive a full refund, minus any unavoidable payment-provider charges (e.g. Stripe or PayPal fees).

* If you ask for your assessment to start within those 14 days and work has already begun (e.g. screening, paperwork preparation, or scoring), the refund may be reduced proportionally to cover work already completed.



### **4. Consultations and single sessions**

* If you cancel or reschedule a single online consultation with **24 hours’ notice or more**, you will receive a **full refund**, minus any payment-provider charges.

* Cancellations with less than 24 hours’ notice are not normally refundable, but you are welcome to reschedule once without extra cost if we can find another suitable time.

* No-shows without notice will be charged in full, unless there is a genuine emergency or accessibility issue.


### **5. Assessments (multi-session packages)**

* Please give at least 7 days’ notice to cancel or reschedule any booked assessment appointments.

* **Before the assessment starts:**

* * Cancel more than 14 days in advance → full refund (minus payment-provider charges).


  * Cancel within 14 days of the first session → 50 % refund, unless no preparatory work has begun, in which case a full refund will be issued.

* **After work has started:**

* * Refunds are not normally available once assessment or report writing has begun, as much of the cost reflects preparation, scoring, and clinical supervision time already undertaken.


  * Exceptional circumstances (for example, illness, bereavement, or significant accessibility barriers) will be considered individually.



### **6. Provider cancellations or technical issues**

If the service needs to cancel or postpone an appointment for any reason, you may choose either:

* a new appointment at no extra cost, or

* a full refund of any unused portion of your fee.



### **7. How refunds are made**

* All refunds are returned using the original payment method.

* Processing may take up to 14 days.

* Any transaction charges from payment providers are non-refundable, as these are retained by the provider, not Together Assessments.



### **8. Compassion and reasonable adjustments**

If you find appointments hard to manage because of executive-function, memory, or anxiety-related difficulties, please tell us. We can offer reminders, alternative booking formats, or other reasonable adjustments to make attendance easier.



### **9. Review**

This policy will be reviewed annually or sooner if required by changes in legislation, guidance, or service delivery.
