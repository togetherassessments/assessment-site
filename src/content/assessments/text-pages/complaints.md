## **Complaints Policy**

**Together Assessments**
Version 1.0 – August 2025
Review date: August 2026 (or sooner if guidance changes)

### **1. Policy Statement**

Together Assessments is committed to providing high-quality, person-centred services. We recognise that sometimes clients, carers, or others may be dissatisfied with an aspect of our service. This policy sets out how complaints can be raised, how they will be handled, and the rights of self-funded and other clients to a fair and timely resolution.

This policy complies with:

* CQC Regulation 16 – Receiving and acting on complaints
* Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014
* Consumer Rights Act 2015 (for self-funded clients)
* Equality Act 2010 – making the process accessible and non-discriminatory

### **2. Scope**

A complaint is any expression of dissatisfaction, whether justified or not, about:

* The service provided
* The conduct of the Sole Trader or contractors
* Communication or administration
* Fees, billing, or contractual matters
* Reports, assessments, or outcomes

Complaints can be made by:

* Clients (self-funded or otherwise)
* Parents/carers/representatives (with consent)
* Other professionals involved in a client’s care



### **3. Principles**

We will:

* Take all complaints seriously and handle them fairly, respectfully, and promptly
* Acknowledge complaints within 3 working days
* Provide a full written response within 28 calendar days (or explain any delay)
* Keep records of all complaints for at least 3 years
* Use complaint outcomes to improve services



### **4. How to Make a Complaint**

Complaints can be made verbally, in writing, or by email:

* **Designated Complaints Contact:**
   Adriana Ferrari
   Email: enquiries@togetherassessments.co.uk
   Tel: 01469 686482

If the complaint involves Adriana Ferrari or you feel unable to raise it with her, you may contact:

* **Clinical Supervisor:** HCPC-registered Clinical Psychologist (details provided to clients on request)\
  supervisor@togetherassessments.co.uk

### **5. Procedure**

**Stage 1 – Informal Resolution**
 Where appropriate, complaints will be addressed quickly through discussion and mutual agreement.

**Stage 2 – Formal Complaint**

1. **Acknowledgement** within 3 working days.
2. **Investigation** by Adriana Ferrari (or Clinical Supervisor if the complaint is about Adriana Ferrari).
3. **Written Response** issued within 28 calendar days, including:
4. * Findings and conclusions

   * Any remedial actions taken

   * How to escalate if dissatisfied

**Stage 3 – External Review**
If you remain dissatisfied after Stage 2, you may request an independent review. This will be carried out by an external HCPC-registered Clinical Psychologist who is independent of Together Assessments, has no recent financial or professional relationship with the service, and is agreed in writing by both parties. The reviewer will consider all relevant information, may speak to both parties, and will produce a written outcome within 28 days.

The cost of this review will be split 50/50 by the provider and the client unless otherwise agreed in writing.

You may also raise concerns with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) or your local Safeguarding Adults Board at any stage.

* **Care Quality Commission (CQC)** – while the CQC does not resolve individual complaints, they can be informed about concerns regarding a regulated service.
  Tel: 03000 616161 | Email: enquiries@cqc.org.uk
* **Professional regulator (HCPC)** - for clinical supervisors
* **Local Government & Social Care Ombudsman** (LGSCO) – particularly for publicly funded services
  Tel: 0300 061 0614 | www.lgo.org.uk



### **6. Complaints from Self-Funded Clients**

Self-funded clients retain full rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015.

* Complaints will be handled with the same standards and timescales as above.
* If resolution cannot be reached, clients can seek independent advice from:
* * Citizens Advice – www.citizensadvice.org.uk

  * Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) providers (details available on request)



### **7. Accessibility**

We will make reasonable adjustments to the complaints process to meet the needs of clients with disabilities, communication difficulties, or other protected characteristics.



### **8. Confidentiality**

All complaints will be handled in confidence, with information shared only on a need-to-know basis.



### **9. Learning from Complaints**

We will record the nature, outcome, and actions taken for each complaint, review trends annually, and use findings to improve our service.



### **10. Review**

This policy will be reviewed annually or sooner if required by changes in legislation, guidance, or service delivery.
