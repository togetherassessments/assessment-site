* **Who I am**: My name is Adriana (she/they). I am an independent practitioner with nearly a decade of NHS experience. I have training and experience in neurodevelopmental assessments and formulation. I identify as disabled, queer, and neurodivergent. I am passionate about providing an accessible and supportive service. My practice is supervised by an HCPC-registered Clinical Psychologist who also identifies as disabled, LGBTQ+, and neurodivergent. 
* **My approach**: Neuro-affirming, strengths-based, and collaborative.
* **Who I work with**: Adults aged 18+ in North Lincolnshire and surrounding areas, some nationwide services can be provided online.
* **What to expect**: Structured conversations, evidence-based tools, and clear recommendations you can share with your GP, workplace, or university. All assessments and reports are co-signed by an HCPC-registered Clinical Psychologist.
