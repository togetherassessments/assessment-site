  Seeking a diagnostic assessment? 

  The services I currently offer **do not** include formal diagnoses or prescriptions. Services which do include formal diagnosis of Autism or ADHD, if appropriate, but not prescriptions are [currently wait-listed with an anticipated wait time of 3 or more months; the costs of these may vary during that time. However, I will always do my best to be as reasonably priced as possible.](<>)
