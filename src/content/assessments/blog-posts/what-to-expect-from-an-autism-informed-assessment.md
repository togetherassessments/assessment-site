# **What to expect from an autism-informed assessment**

A practical guide to help you understand what to expect and how to prepare



## **Introduction**

Starting an autism assessment can feel like a big step. At Together Assessments, the process is designed to be clear, supportive, and paced to your needs. This guide explains what you can expect from working with me, how to prepare, to help make the experience as comfortable as possible.

## **Free 15-Minute Consultation**

Before beginning, you can book a free consultation (video, phone, or chat). This gives you a chance to:

* meet me and ask any questions
* decide if the service feels like the right fit for you
* talk briefly about your main concerns and hopes


## **Step 1: Developmental History Appointment**

If you decide to go ahead, the next step is a longer appointment (which can be broken up if you wish) to go through your developmental history. This helps me understand:

* your experiences growing up
* strengths and challenges across different parts of life
* any patterns that may be linked to autism



## **Step 2: Questionnaires**

Depending on your needs, you may be asked to complete questionnaires.

* If I think they are suitable for you, I’ll send these out in advance.
* If filling them in on your own feels difficult, we can complete them together during a session with my support.


## **Step 3: Ongoing Sessions (Online or In-Person)**

Most sessions can be done online from the comfort of your home. If you prefer, we can arrange to complete some sessions in person at your home. Please note:

* There may be a small mileage fee for additional in-person visits.
* Having assessments in your own space gives you full control over the sensory environment.
* You don’t need to bring anything — but you are welcome to have a friend, family member, or supporter with you.


## **Step 5: Face-to-Face Observational Session**

Towards the end of the assessment process, there will be a face-to-face session in your home. This may involve simple tasks and activities. The purpose is to build a complete picture of your profile in a setting that feels natural and safe.

## **Video Recording Consent**

Where possible, I will video record assessment sessions. This helps ensure reliability and accuracy in scoring and reporting. I will always ask for your consent before recording. If you do not wish to be recorded, please let me know in advance — although this may mean I cannot provide the service.

## **Sharing Documents & Reports**

It can be really helpful if you have previous reports, letters, or documents that you’d like me to see. Examples might include:

* school or university reports
* occupational health or workplace reports
* past assessments or letters from professionals


**How to share these securely:**

* If you have a Gmail account, you can upload documents here: <https://forms.gle/3RN7kePCjS829on19>. 
* Alternatively, you can email password-protected attachments with a password shared separately.
* Or, of course, you’re welcome to hand me copies when you meet me face-to-face.
* If you’re unsure, I can provide clear instructions when you’re ready to share.


## **Support During the Process**

* You are welcome to have someone with you in both online and in-person sessions.
* Breaks are always allowed.
* Adjustments can be made at any stage — you don’t need to choose them upfront.

## **After the Assessment**

When the assessment stage is complete, I will:

* **Meet with you again** (by video, phone, or chat — whichever you prefer) to talk through the findings in detail.
* Provide you with a **draft written report**. This is your opportunity to give feedback, suggest changes to the language, and make sure the tone and voice reflect your perspective. This step is optional, but it often helps ensure the report feels accurate and collaborative.
* Once we are both happy with the content, my supervisor and I will finalise the report.


With your consent, I can also share the final report with:

* your GP
* workplace or university
* other relevant professionals

If at this stage you feel you would benefit from further input, you are very welcome to book support sessions through my website. These can focus on putting recommendations into practice, exploring adjustments, or ongoing guidance.
