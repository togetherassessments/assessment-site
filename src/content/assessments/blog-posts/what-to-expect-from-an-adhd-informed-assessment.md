A practical guide to help you understand what to expect and how to prepare. Please note that details may change depending on your needs and that other services may have a different structure. 



## **Introduction**

Beginning an ADHD assessment can feel like a big step. At Together Assessments, the process is designed to be supportive, flexible, and paced around your needs. This guide explains what you can expect when working with me, how to prepare, and how to make the process as comfortable as possible.



## **Free 15-Minute Consultation**

Before starting, you can book a free consultation (video, phone, or chat). This gives you a chance to:

* meet me and ask any questions
* decide if the service feels like the right fit for you
* talk briefly about your main concerns and hopes



## **Step 1: Developmental Interview**

The first structured session will focus on your developmental history, including:

* your experiences growing up
* how attention, focus, and executive functioning have affected different parts of life
* any strengths, challenges, or patterns that may be linked to ADHD

You are welcome to bring a friend, family member, or supporter with you for this session if you wish.



## **Step 2: Questionnaires**

Depending on your needs, I may ask you to complete some questionnaires.

* If suitable, these will be sent to you in advance to complete at home.
* If filling them in alone feels difficult, we can complete them together during a session with my support.



## **Step 3: QBCheck (Attention & Activity Test)**

You will be asked to complete a **QBCheck**, which is a computer-based task measuring attention and activity.

* This is done **at home, online**, via a secure link I send to you.
* You may have someone in the room for support, but it is designed to be completed independently.
* Clear instructions will be provided before you begin.



## **Step 4: Diagnostic Interview**

This session focuses on tying everything together — your developmental history, questionnaires, and QBCheck results.

* We will explore your current experiences and how ADHD may be impacting your life.
* You are welcome to have a supporter present for this session.
* This can be done online or face-to-face in your home (small mileage fees may apply for travel).



## **Sharing Documents & Reports**

It can be really helpful if you have previous reports, letters, or documents that you’d like me to see, such as:

* school or university reports
* occupational health or workplace reports
* past assessments or letters from professionals



**How to share these securely:**

* If you have a Gmail account, you can upload documents here: [Together Assessments secure upload form](https://forms.gle/3RN7kePCjS829on19). 
* Alternatively, you can email password-protected attachments with the password shared separately.
* Or hand me copies if we meet face-to-face.

If you’re unsure, I’ll provide clear instructions when you’re ready to share.



## **Support During the Process**

* You are welcome to have someone with you in both online and in-person sessions.
* Breaks are always allowed.
* Adjustments can be made at any stage — you don’t need to choose them upfront.



## **After the Assessment**

When the assessment stage is complete, I will:

* **Meet with you again** (video, phone, or chat) to talk through the findings in detail.
* Provide you with a **draft written report**. You have the option to give feedback and request adjustments to language, tone, or focus so it feels right for you.
* Once we are both happy, my supervisor and I will finalise the report.


With your consent, I can also share the final report with:

* your GP
* workplace or university
* other relevant professionals

If at this stage you feel you would benefit from further input, you are very welcome to book support sessions through my website. These can help you put recommendations into practice, explore adjustments, or access ongoing guidance.
