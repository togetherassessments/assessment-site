# Designing for Accessibility: How Together Assessments Builds Inclusion Into Every Aspect

At Together Assessments, accessibility isn’t an afterthought – it’s a starting point. From the very first sketches of the logo to the structure of each webpage, every decision has been guided by the question:  

> “How can this design make things easier, clearer, and more comfortable for neurodivergent adults?”


## Visual Accessibility: Design that Works for Everyone

Our logo and brand colours were chosen with colour-blind accessibility in mind. Text contrast ratios meet WCAG standards, and speech-to-text is available throughout the website. Where images appear, text descriptions (alt-text) ensure that screen readers can convey the same meaning to every visitor.

We’ve also avoided placing important text directly over images, ensuring that words remain crisp, high-contrast, and easy to read — regardless of device, theme, or lighting conditions.


## Fonts Developed for Neurodiverse Readers

Font choice makes a world of difference for readability. Our website offers several research-based typefaces designed to support people with dyslexia, ADHD, and other neurodivergent experiences:

* **Sylexiad Sans**, created by Dr Robert Hillier, is our default font – specifically designed to reduce letter confusion and visual stress.\
  [Download Sylexiad here](https://www.sylexiad.com/)
* **OpenDyslexic**, by Abelardo Gonzalez, is available as an alternative option.\
  [Download OpenDyslexic here](https://opendyslexic.org/)
* **Fast Syldexia**, an adapted “fast font” version of Sylexiad, was developed in-house following open-source accessibility research and can be especially helpful for people with ADHD.
* **Bespoke title fonts** were designed by Adriana, blending principles from Sylexiad, OpenDyslexic, and the Braille Institute’s Atkinson Hyperlegible font to create an aesthetic that remains accessible and clear.\

## User-Controlled Accessibility Settings

Visitors can adjust the website’s **Accessibility Settings** (found at the top right) to suit their preferences — and preferences are remembered for future visits.

**Available options include:**

* Switch between fonts (**Sylexiad Sans**, **OpenDyslexic**, **Fast Syldexia**)
* Switch between **light**, **dark**, or **system** themes
* Modify **text size** (from small to extra-large)
* Adjust **line height** for easier tracking
* Use a **reading ruler** to highlight the current line
* Activate **text-to-speech** to listen to any text

These settings are especially helpful for neurodivergent adults, whose sensory, processing, and cognitive needs can vary day-to-day. Providing flexible tools supports autonomy, reduces fatigue, and ensures that information remains accessible in the way that works best for each person.

It's important for people to see from the start that this is a space where needs are considered and identities are both welcomed and celebrated.


## Ethical Design: Grounded in Equity and Transparency

Our approach to accessibility is deeply connected to our wider ethics of equity and inclusion. Accessibility isn’t a compliance box to tick – it’s part of how we express respect, fairness, and care for those we serve.

Behind the scenes, we’ve implemented robust information-security, data-protection, and AI-use policies that safeguard client privacy and autonomy. Every tool, from screen-reader compatibility to data storage, is assessed through the lens of dignity and inclusion.


## Co-Production and Continuous Improvement

We recognise that accessibility is not a one-time achievement but an ongoing process. While we’ve worked hard to embed best practice throughout our design, we know there will always be more to learn.

That’s why we’re committed to co-producing future updates with service users. Feedback from people who use the site – especially those with lived experience of neurodivergence or disability – is central to how we evolve. We invite visitors to share what works well, what doesn’t, and what could make the experience even better.


## In Summary

Accessibility at Together Assessments is about more than web design. It’s about creating a digital environment that reflects our values of equity, respect, and inclusion. From ethical font choices and clear layouts to responsive settings and transparent data practices, every element exists to make our space as welcoming and usable as possible.

We’ll continue refining this work in partnership with the people who matter most — the community we serve.\
