# **Workplace Adjustments Guide**

**Notes on accommodations and conversations for the workplace**

## **Why workplace adjustments matter**

* Adjustments level the playing field — they are not “special treatment.”

* Under the **Equality Act 2010**, you are protected as disabled if your condition has a substantial impact on daily life and has affected you for 12 months or longer.

* **No formal diagnosis is required** to be eligible for these protections.

* Employers have a **legal duty** to make reasonable adjustments once they know you are disabled.



## **Talking about adjustments**

* You do not have to disclose your full medical history.

* You could say something as simple as:

   “I’m neurodivergent, and I would benefit from some adjustments to help me work more effectively.”

* Adjustments should be discussed in a supportive meeting with Occupational Health or your line manager.

* You can request a written record of what has been agreed.



## **Common workplace adjustments for ADHD & Autism**

(These are examples — adjustments should always be tailored to the individual)

### **Environment & Sensory**

* Option to work in a quieter area or use noise-cancelling headphones.

* Access to natural light, desk lamps, or softer lighting.

* Permission to use fidget items or sensory aids at your desk.

* Clear signage, uncluttered workspace, and predictable layouts.


### **Communication**

* Written instructions or summaries after meetings.

* Advance notice of changes to schedules or tasks.

* Option to use plain, clear language instead of jargon.

* Flexibility to process information before responding.


### **Organisation & Productivity**

* Use of task management software or visual planners.

* Shorter, more regular check-ins instead of one long supervision.

* Extended time for training or exams.

* Option to record meetings or use note-taking software.


### **Working Pattern**

* Flexible start/finish times to avoid peak-hour sensory overload.

* Working from home part of the week.

* More frequent breaks to help manage focus or sensory needs.

* Adjusted workload pacing (fewer urgent, high-pressure deadlines at once).



### **Technology & Equipment**

* Screen readers, dictation tools, or text-to-speech software.

* Apps for reminders and time management.

* Coloured overlays or filters for computer screens.

* Quiet keyboards, larger monitors, or ergonomic setups.



## **Frameworks and Support**

* **Equality Act 2010** → provides the legal right to adjustments.

* **Access to Work (DWP)** → government scheme funding workplace needs assessments, equipment, coaching, and sometimes support workers.

* **Occupational Health** → can make independent recommendations to your employer.

* **Disabled Student's Allowance (DSA)** → may be available if you are in higher education.
