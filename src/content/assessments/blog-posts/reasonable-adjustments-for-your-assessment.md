# Reasonable adjustments for your assessment

Every person experiences the world differently. During assessments, we aim to make things as comfortable, fair, and accessible as possible. Some approaches are part of our default way of working. Others can be adapted to suit your needs or preferences.  

You can let us know your preferences before or during your free 15-minute consultation, or at any point in the assessment process. There is no limit on what you can ask for, you can change your mind, and we will always try to meet your needs wherever possible.

* Choice of paper colour for printed materials 
* Choice of font style, size, colour, or line spacing

We can also provide guidance on next steps, including support services, workplace or educational adjustments, or applications such as Access to Work or Disabled Students Allowance.  

Follow-up support sessions can be booked at any time.
