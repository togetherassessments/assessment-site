  Autism: Understanding Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)


  Autism, also known as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a lifelong neurodevelopmental difference that affects how people communicate, process information, and experience the world. Autism is called a “spectrum” because it includes a wide range of traits, strengths, and support needs — no two autistic people are the same.


  Common characteristics include differences in social communication, sensory processing, routine and structure preferences, and focused or specialised interests. Many autistic individuals may also experience differences in learning style, emotional regulation, or executive functioning.


  Autism is not a disease or something to be “cured”; it’s a form of neurodiversity — a natural variation in human brains and behaviour. Autistic people often bring valuable perspectives, creativity, logical thinking, and deep expertise to their work and relationships.


  Early understanding, acceptance, and appropriate support — such as therapy, coaching, accessible education, and inclusive workplaces — can help autistic individuals thrive.
