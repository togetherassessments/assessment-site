  ADHD: Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder


  Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition that affects focus, organisation, motivation, and impulse control. People with ADHD often experience differences in attention span, energy levels, and executive functioning, which can impact work, learning, relationships, and daily life.


  ADHD is typically divided into three types — inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, and combined — and can present differently in children, teens, and adults.

  Common symptoms include difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, restlessness, fidgeting, emotional sensitivity, and challenges with time management.


  Although ADHD is often seen as a disorder of attention, many experts recognise it as a different way of processing information — one that can also bring strengths such as creativity, innovation, high energy, problem-solving ability, and hyperfocus on areas of interest.


  Treatment and support options include behavioural strategies, coaching, therapy, lifestyle adjustments, and medication. With understanding and the right tools, people with ADHD can thrive both personally and professionally.
