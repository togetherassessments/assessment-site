question: Can you provide a diagnosis?
answer: >
  No. This service is not currently able to provide formal diagnoses following
  assessments. 


  [If you are seeking a formal diagnosis, the wait for these can be joined here](https://forms.gle/PbSduh2fVq3bbuKE8). It is not clear how long the waitlist will be though a minimum of three months wait is currently anticipated. The costs of these may vary during the waiting time. However, I will always do my best to be as reasonably priced as possible. Further information can be found on [https://togetherADHD.co.uk](https://togetherADHD.co.uk) and [https://togetherAutism.co.uk](https://togetherAutism.co.uk).
