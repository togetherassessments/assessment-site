question: Are assessments available online?
answer: Yes, I offer both in-person and online assessments via secure video
  consultation. While it is entirely your choice if sessions are online or
  within your home, there may be situations in which I recommend at least one
  home-visit for the highest possible assessment standard. I should be able to
  inform you of this in or following [your free 15 minute
  consultation](https://calendar.app.google/F5uKAijroSm64ryn9).
