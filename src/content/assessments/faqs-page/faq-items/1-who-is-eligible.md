question: Who is eligible?
answer: >-
  Services are for adults aged 18+ who can consent to the assessment process. 


  Most of my services can be offered online or via home visits [within my catchment area](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Xthspzi56XfmwEi88). If a home visit is clinically recommended, I can inform you of this within [your free 15-minute consultation](https://calendar.app.google/F5uKAijroSm64ryn9). 


  For home visits, it is required that your home is psychologically safe for the adult being assessed, with a private space, with a table and two chairs available.
