question: What happens after the assessment?
answer: "Following your assessment, you'll receive a comprehensive report
  detailing the findings, and personalised recommendations. We'll discuss the
  results with you, giving you the opportunity to make changes to your report
  before this is finalised. I'll also provide guidance on next steps, which
  might include support services, workplace or educational adjustments.
  Follow-up support sessions can also be booked with myself at any time. "
