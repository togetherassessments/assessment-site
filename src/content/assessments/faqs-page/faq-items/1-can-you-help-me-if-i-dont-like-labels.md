question: Can you help me if I don't like labels?
answer: "Yes, I am delighted to be able to offer in depth assessments and
  recommendations without labels. Often services can insist on labels or
  diagnoses despite relevant legislation and guidelines (e.g. the equality act
  2010, the NHS constitution) not requiring these. I will offer support to the
  best of my ability to ensure that this does not pose a barrier to accessing
  support that my assessments indicate would be needed. "
