Please note, the services below, which include formal diagnosis, if appropriate, but not prescriptions are currently [wait-listed](https://forms.gle/PbSduh2fVq3bbuKE8) with an anticipated wait time of 3 or more months; the costs of these may vary during that time.

**Non-diagnostic assessment options**, which are currently not waitlistedcan be found on[ togetherassessments.co.uk.](http://togetherassessments.co.uk/fees)

**Financial Health Inequality**\
I am personally and professionally motivated by equity, and I understand costs can be a larger barrier to some, so I am actively seeking ways to subsidise my offerings for anyone who otherwise couldn't access my services. If this applies to you, please do let me know, and I might be able to support you in reducing or eliminating costs prior to my registration on the right-to-choose register which can be a lengthy process.

If you are able and interested in contributing towards a fund for people for whom cost is a barrier, please [get in touch.](peersupport@togetherautism.co.uk)
