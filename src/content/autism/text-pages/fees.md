**Travel**: One home visit [within my local area](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Xthspzi56XfmwEi88) is included in each assessment price.\
If additional travel is required mileage and tolls may be charged. 

Please note, the services I currently offer **do not** include formal diagnoses or prescriptions. Services which do include formal diagnosis, if appropriate, but not prescriptions are currently [wait-listed](https://forms.gle/PbSduh2fVq3bbuKE8) with an anticipated wait time of 3 or more months; the costs of these may vary during that time. However, I will always do my best to be as reasonably priced as possible.\

Autism Assessment (this assessment requires at least one home visit) - £1100\
ADHD Assessment (my service cannot offer prescriptions or medication following a diagnosis at this time) - £500\
Combined Autism and ADHD assessment (as above) - £1300\

**Financial Health Inequality**\
I am personally and professionally motivated by equity, and I understand costs can be a larger barrier to some, so I am actively seeking ways to subsidise my offerings for anyone who otherwise couldn't access my services. If this applies to you, please do let me know, and I might be able to support you in reducing or eliminating costs prior to my registration on the right-to-choose register which can be a lengthy process.

If you are able and interested in contributing towards a fund for people for whom cost is a barrier, please get in touch.
