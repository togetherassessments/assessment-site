## **About Our Service**

Together Autism provides specialist diagnostic assessments for autism and ADHD for adults (aged 18+), pending CQC registration. Prior to CQC registration Together Autism will solely provide a self-referring wait-list for this service and signpost to other services, including togetherassessments.co.uk, which offers non-diagnostic assessments. 

Our assessments follow NICE guidelines (CG142 for Autism, NG87 for ADHD) and are delivered in a respectful, person-centred, and neuro-affirming way.

We aim to provide a clear, fair, and accessible service where people feel listened to, understood, and supported.


## **What We Provide - pending CQC registration**

* Autism assessments (using recognised tools such as ADOS-2, ADI-R, self-report measures, and developmental history).
* ADHD assessments (using DIVA-5, QbCheck, and related self-report tools).
* Written diagnostic reports, including strengths, challenges, and recommendations for reasonable adjustments and support.
* A post-assessment feedback session to explain results clearly and answer questions.
* Signposting to further support and services where needed.


## **What We Do Not Provide**

* Assessments for children or young people under 18.
* Formal diagnosis prior to CQC registration. 
* Medication prescribing or reviews.
* Ongoing therapy, treatment, or case management.
* Crisis or emergency services.

If your needs fall outside what we can provide, we will do our best to signpost you to a more suitable service.

## **How We Decide if We Can Meet Your Needs**

Before any assessment, we carry out a free 15-minute consultation and a pre-screening call. During this process, we check:

* You are aged 18 or over.
* You are able to give informed consent.
* You are able to take part in structured interviews and psychometric assessments (with or without reasonable adjustments).
* You are not currently in a psychiatric crisis or presenting with very complex needs that would be better supported by a larger team (e.g. severe mental illness, significant intellectual disability, or high safeguarding risks).
* You are able to wait for our CQC registration to complete. 

If we are not the right service for you, we will explain why and, where possible, provide information on alternative providers.
