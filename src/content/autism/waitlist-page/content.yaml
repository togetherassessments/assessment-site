  Seeking a diagnostic assessment? \

  The services I currently offer **do not** include formal diagnoses or prescriptions. Services which do include formal diagnosis, if appropriate, but not prescriptions are [currently wait-listed with an anticipated wait time of 3 or more months; the costs of these may vary during that time. However, I will always do my best to be as reasonably priced as possible.](https://forms.gle/PbSduh2fVq3bbuKE8)


  Autism Assessment (this assessment requires at least one home visit) - £1100 \

  ADHD Assessment (my service cannot offer prescriptions or medication following a diagnosis at this time) - £500 Combined Autism and ADHD assessment (as above) - £1300
