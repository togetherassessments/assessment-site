question: Can you prescribe medication?
answer: >-
  No. While autistic people may struggle with their emotions and other aspects
  of daily living, there is no UK-licensed medication for autism at this time -
  nor do I think there should be. 


  I am also not a prescriber so cannot prescribe medication. If medication is sought and indicated, I can guide you on discussing this with your GP.
