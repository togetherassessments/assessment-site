question: Do you make reasonable adjustments?
answer: >-
  Yes, adjustments are standard and you can request any specific changes. 


  **As standard I will:**

  - bring a small sensory kit to home visits

  - offer longer appointment sessions

  - offer various communication methods

  - welcome carers, family members, friends or pets that you'd like to have as support in any sessions

  - provide visual information at size 14, in a dyslexia-friendly font and be colour-blind friendly

  - let you select the best time and day for you

  - offer you a break

  - give you my pronouns (she/they) and inquire if you're comfortable sharing yours


  You can request any specific changes. 

  **For example, I can also:**

  - use some makaton (speech-assisted signing)

  - use easy read for visual information

  - provide shorter sessions

  - provide regular breaks

  - use any preferred font, size, and coloured paper for visual information

  - ensure I arrive to a home visit without wearing any perfumes or deodorants
