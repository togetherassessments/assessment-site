question: Can you provide a diagnosis?
answer: >-
  Yes, if appropriate, we will be able to provide you with a formal diagnosis.
  [This service is currently waitlisted and can be joined
  here](https://forms.gle/PbSduh2fVq3bbuKE8). It is not clear how long the
  waitlist will be though a minimum of three months wait is currently
  anticipated. The costs of these may vary during the waiting time. However, I
  will always do my best to be as reasonably priced as possible.


  If you are not in need of a formal diagnosis and would prefer not to wait, [please see my services at Together Assessments](https://togetherassessments.co.uk).
