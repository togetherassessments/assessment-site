  **Can you prescribe medication?**


  No. I am not a prescriber. If medication is indicated, I can guide you on discussing this with your GP.


  **Can I use Right to Choose?**


  Not at this time. This service is independent and not yet part of NHS Right to Choose.


  **Can you provide a diagnosis?**


  No. Together Assessments provides specialist assessments, formulations, and recommendations only. If you require a formal diagnosis, please [join the waitlist](https://forms.gle/PbSduh2fVq3bbuKE8) and find more information at [Together ADHD](https://togetheradhd.co.uk) or [Together Autism](https://togetherautism.co.uk).


  **Do you record appointments?**


  Yes — with your consent. Video recording ensures scoring accuracy and reliability. If you are not comfortable with this, I may not be the right provider.


  **Can I be accompanied?**


  Yes. You are welcome to have a supporter present at any time. 


  **Do you make reasonable adjustments?**


  Yes, adjustments are standard. You can request specific changes or choose from a suggested menu.


  **Who is eligible?**


  Services are for adults aged 18+. Autism assessments require that your home is psychologically safe, private, and has a table and two chairs available. 


  **Where are you based?**


  I am based in North Lincolnshire and offer home assessments in [the surrounding areas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Xthspzi56XfmwEi88). Many assessments can be offered online if preferred. I should be able to advise you if I am able to complete your assessment fully online or if a home assessment may be needed in your free consultation. 


  **Can you help me if I don't like labels?**


  Yes, I am delighted to be able to offer in depth assessments without labels.
